I should probably rephrase. The internet is a great place to be terrible at things if you're willing to listen when needed
and to work at it. The sum of human knowledge is at our fingertips, on our smartphones, waiting for us on our tablets (even on our fridges, yeah, wtf). 

The amount of learning you can possibly do in a day is overwhelming at times.
