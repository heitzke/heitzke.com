    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, again, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to read a bit more often. After attending UXWeek in San Fran a few months ago I heard Austin Kleon give a great talk on &amp;#8216;Stealing like an Artist&amp;#8217;. After throughly enjoying his talk, I found that he wrote a book that shared a title with his talk. (it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://www.austinkleon.com/steal/'&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s great)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, again, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to read a bit more often. After attending UXWeek in San Fran a few months ago I heard Austin Kleon give a great talk on &amp;#8216;Stealing like an Artist&amp;#8217;. After throughly enjoying his talk, I found that he wrote a book that shared a title with his talk. (it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://www.austinkleon.com/steal/'&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s great)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, it&amp;#8217;s a nice and short read, but one of the parts that really stuck out to me was about how you shouldn&amp;#8217;t give up on hobbies and outlets that don&amp;#8217;t seem to fit inline with your career. Personally, I grew up around cars and auto work and it evolved into an amazingly wonderful albeit &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;taxing&lt;/em&gt;. Naturally, there isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot of connection between auto work and development, but it&amp;#8217;s a very rewarding release to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; get out there and truly work with your hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='1_if_you_dont_have_all_the_right_tools_to_start_youre_going_to_have_a_bad_time'&gt;1. If you don&amp;#8217;t have all the right tools to start, you&amp;#8217;re going to have a bad time.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a really long time to learn this lesson in the garage. If you need an obscure specialty tool, you need to get that shit before you start. I&amp;#8217;ve tried making, modifying and hacking together more mechanical fixes than I care to admit. Does this sort of idea work? Sure, but you either spend way more time than necessary or you end up making the problem worse. Wrenches make good hammers sometimes, but if you need a hammer&amp;#8230; use one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In development, it&amp;#8217;s also so easy to end up using the wrong tools if you haven&amp;#8217;t decided what you need before you get in deep. Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong though, project scopes change, things break and there are surprises around every corner. You need to be flexible, but that&amp;#8217;s no reason to not be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='2_dont_get_overly_emotional__take_your_time'&gt;2. Don&amp;#8217;t get overly emotional (&amp;amp; take your time).&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, things get worse as you get into an auto project. Garbage plastic clips break (damn you late model vehicles!), bolts snap and things get rusted. Rusty bolts can make your quick bolt-on a nightmare, but getting frustrated and applying torque to bolts without making sure wrenches &amp;amp; sockets are seated will make your day even worse. No one likes a rounded bolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development can really suck sometimes. Two-line code changes turn into week long projects but getting upset and writing garbage code to get a project turned out isn&amp;#8217;t the right way to do it. You can&amp;#8217;t always know what you&amp;#8217;re getting into before you&amp;#8217;re there, so be patient. Take your time and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='3_keep_your_tools_clean'&gt;3. Keep your tools clean.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take my word for it. Clean your tools off as you use them. All it takes is one grease covered ball-joint fork to effectively infect all of your tools and make it impossible to touch anything in the future. Being lazy for a minute is going to lead to you accidentally getting grease all over your work clothes and/or interior (ask me how I know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;#8217;re slinging html/css, indent that shit. Try to keep your div-itis in check, DRY, yada yada. Seriously just keep it as clean as possible and it&amp;#8217;ll make your life easier as you continue (hopefully) to iterate on projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbies can &amp;amp; will improve your work if you let them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, seems that I&amp;#8217;ve finally decided to add a little blog to the site. Noting that the current time is indeed 1:48 a.m. on a Saturday night (nerd alert, anyone?) the &amp;#8216;example article&amp;#8217; that ships with the Middleman-blog setup isn&amp;#8217;t really cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, seems that I&amp;#8217;ve finally decided to add a little blog to the site. Noting that the current time is indeed 1:48 a.m. on a Saturday night (nerd alert, anyone?) the &amp;#8216;example article&amp;#8217; that ships with the Middleman-blog setup isn&amp;#8217;t really cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said I figured i&amp;#8217;d write about the tech used to build &amp;amp; launch the little site. The framework is Middleman 3.0 with the associated middleman-blog extension. It&amp;#8217;s simply wonderful. It ships with compass &amp;amp; haml already rocking on it which makes me immensely happy. If you haven&amp;#8217;t working with either before, do yourself a huge favor and just do it. I primarily work in rails environments these days, so if you don&amp;#8217;t, you&amp;#8217;re screwed or something (maybe?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Middleman is wonderful for generating static sites while still allowing you to use the dev tools that you&amp;#8217;re used to utilizing. It&amp;#8217;s super flexible and allows you to pretty much do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is currently on a free heroku server (Thanks Heroku, I love you and I promise I&amp;#8217;ll pay soon). Heroku is another fantastic tool to try out and use. Basically, jump on heroku.com, make a login and once you&amp;#8217;re in your local project folder, enter your credentials - &amp;#8216;heroku login&amp;#8217;, create a unique heroku project &amp;#8216;heroku create&amp;#8217;, and then BAM &amp;#8216;git push heroku master&amp;#8217; and your code is now &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217;. I use the term live loosely, as it&amp;#8217;ll be deployed to &amp;#8216;blazing-dragon-flower-face-9872&amp;#8217; or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see at the bottom of the blog post, I dropped in Disqus for comments (also insanely easy to integrate).&lt;/p&gt;</content>
