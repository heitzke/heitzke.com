    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, seems that I&amp;#8217;ve finally decided to add a little blog to the site. Noting that the current time is indeed 1:48 a.m. on a Saturday night (nerd alert, anyone?) the &amp;#8216;example article&amp;#8217; that ships with the Middleman-blog setup isn&amp;#8217;t really cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, seems that I&amp;#8217;ve finally decided to add a little blog to the site. Noting that the current time is indeed 1:48 a.m. on a Saturday night (nerd alert, anyone?) the &amp;#8216;example article&amp;#8217; that ships with the Middleman-blog setup isn&amp;#8217;t really cutting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said I figured i&amp;#8217;d write about the tech used to build &amp;amp; launch the little site. The framework is Middleman 3.0 with the associated middleman-blog extension. It&amp;#8217;s simply wonderful. It ships with compass &amp;amp; haml already rocking on it which makes me immensely happy. If you haven&amp;#8217;t working with either before, do yourself a huge favor and just do it. I primarily work in rails environments these days, so if you don&amp;#8217;t, you&amp;#8217;re screwed or something (maybe?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Middleman is wonderful for generating static sites while still allowing you to use the dev tools that you&amp;#8217;re used to utilizing. It&amp;#8217;s super flexible and allows you to pretty much do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is currently on a free heroku server (Thanks Heroku, I love you and I promise I&amp;#8217;ll pay soon). Heroku is another fantastic tool to try out and use. Basically, jump on heroku.com, make a login and once you&amp;#8217;re in your local project folder, enter your credentials - &amp;#8216;heroku login&amp;#8217;, create a unique heroku project &amp;#8216;heroku create&amp;#8217;, and then BAM &amp;#8216;git push heroku master&amp;#8217; and your code is now &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217;. I use the term live loosely, as it&amp;#8217;ll be deployed to &amp;#8216;blazing-dragon-flower-face-9872&amp;#8217; or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see at the bottom of the blog post, I dropped in Disqus for comments (also insanely easy to integrate).&lt;/p&gt;</content>
