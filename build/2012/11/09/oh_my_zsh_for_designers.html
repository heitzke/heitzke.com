      <h2>Oh-My-ZSH for designers (too)</h2>
      <div class='page_content blog'>
        <p>Designers, don't fear the command line. The shell doesn't have to be a scary &amp; ugly thing to use, it can <em>actually</em> be somewhat enjoyable (at times). It's really not that bad, plus it gains you all kinds of street cred (or something). I really only started learning/using it because all the guys at Isotope11 made fun of me until I did. Now I can act pretentious and tell people to learn it too. This all really isn't about learning it any way, it's about making it better to use.</p>
        
        <p>The default shell that ships with Linux and OSX is Bash. It looks a little something like this -
        <img src="/images/zsh/bash.png" alt="Alt text" />
        Admittedly, my Bash profile is super plain and pretty difficult to use. I messed around with editing my .bashrc, adding aliases etc. and still just ended up disappointed. One day after bitching about my frequent git typos, I heard about something called 'Oh-my-zsh' in a response to my rants. Again, some sort of great secret had eluded me. </p>
        
        <h3 id="oh-my-zsh">Oh-my-ZSH</h3>
        <p>So if Bash is the shell that ships on Unix computers, what the hell is Z Shell? Basically it's an extended Bourne shell that borrows features from other shells (bash, ksh, tcsh). </p>
        
        <h3 id="installing">Installing</h3>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">Github Instructions</a></p>
        
        <p>I installed via curl:</p>
        <pre><code>curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh</code></pre>
        
        <p>Set ZSH as your default shell</p>
        <pre><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code></pre>
        
        <p>Then you should be seeing something like this guy:
        <img src="/images/zsh/zsh1.png" alt="Alt text" />
        The default theme isn't great looking. Not all super impressive yet, I know. It gets better though with the next step.</p>
        
        <p>Vim ~/.zshrc and scroll down to plugins &amp; theme
        <img src="/images/zsh/zsh2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
        
        <p>This is really the cool part, all of these plugins make life really easy. For example, here is a list of all the git aliases the git plugin adds: 
        <a href="http://jasonm23.github.com/oh-my-git-aliases.html">Git Plugin Cheatsheet</a></p>
        
        <p>There are also tons of themes that come packaged with this. 
        <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes">List of Themes</a></p>
        
        <p>Personally, I'm using gnzh and it looks like this: 
        <img src="/images/zsh/zsh3.png" alt="Alt text" />
        That's a hell of a lot better than what I was rocking before, right? Shows me current working branch, gemset and also directory path. Also note me using the alias for 'git status' which is 'gst'. I also just loooove having an entire extra line to type on below. </p>
        
        <p>Luckily, there IS more to it than just pretty colors. 
        - When you tab tab you get a list of possible completions that you can navigate with arrows
        - ZSH shares command history among sessions
        - Spell checking (big win for me)
        - Little indicator shows when there are changes that haven't been committed </p>
        
        <p>There's a lot more to it than this, but that's about the extent of my knowledge. Hell, i'm just a designer. </p>
