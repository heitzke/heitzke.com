        <p>Funny how a different perspective can really change how you view something as trivial as QR codes. QR codes generally have become a pointless tech that we all like to poke fun at, and is best reserved for bullshit local advertisements. <a href="http://www.wtfqrcodes.com">WTFQRcodes</a> is a perfect example. This is what we've all gotten accustomed to. Today I went for a visit to the Alabama Institute for the Deaf &amp; Blind, and was introduced to Voiceye.</p>

        <p><img src="/images/voiceye.png" class="right qr" />
        As you can see right here, Voiceye is simply a super high density QR code that can contain up to 250k characters. Naturally, these codes require a specific reader and are more sensitive to glare and lighting conditions, but have so much potential for accessibility. While we're busy using QR codes for tricking people into visiting lemonparty (don't google this, trust me) the Koreans are using Voiceye to improve the accessibility of their gov't docs. </p>
        
        <p>According to the AIDB, Korea has been using Voiceye codes on the top right of their government documents, which allows for full docs to be downloaded and then read aloud or through Braille readers. There are several applications available for the reading of Voiceye codes; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voiceye/id496389982?mt=8">iPhone download</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voiceye/id496389982?mt=8">iPhone download</a></p>
        
        <h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
        <p>Although sitting back, talking a bunch of shit and being sarcastic is fun, let's continue to look forward a bit and make the web (and the world) a friendlier and more accessible place. In their present form, QR codes aren't good for much. They can't share a ton of information, hard to get most devices to even access them, but conceptually it's a fantastic idea. </p>
        
        <p>Also, granted, this is probably more focused for print type material, the concept has potential. Downloading site content for use offline, storing directionsâ€¦ just a few off of the top of my head. </p>
        
        <p>Basically, we're doing it wrong. </p>
